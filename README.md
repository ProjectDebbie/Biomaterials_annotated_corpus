## Annotated Biomaterial Gold Standard Corpus. 

Version 1.

The biomaterials annotated corpus consists of 1222 biomaterials abstracts describing the evaluation of biomaterials in either a laboratory or a clinical setting.
This corpus has been annotated by the [Biomaterials Annotator](https://github.com/ProjectDebbie/Biomaterials_annotator). 

The corpus was originally curated as a [gold standard](https://github.com/ProjectDebbie/gold_standard_set) to reperesnt the biomaterials literature, and is also available for download as a list of [PMIDs](https://github.com/ProjectDebbie/gold_standard_set/blob/master/gs_original_1230.txt). 

Each abstract is individually contained as a separate file under the GATE format. 

![Table](STATISTICS.csv) shows statistics concerning the number of concepts corresponding to the different categories, as well as the number of total entities, sentences and tokens.
